Numerical Analysis
COSC 85A

Compilation of numerical computations such as
fibonnaci, venn diagrams and set, determinants, cramer's rule and gaussian elimination.

At has a gui that is able to print a summary of the computations and print it to pdf file.

As of now fibonnaci, determinants, cramer's rule have a function.

NOTE: 
to be able to save a pdf file use or import this library to your project from this directory 'lib\itextpdf-5.5.4.jar'
