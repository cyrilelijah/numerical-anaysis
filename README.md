COSC 85A

Compilation of numerical computations such as
fibonnaci, venn diagrams and set, determinants, cramer's rule and gaussian elimination.

It has a gui that is able to print a summary of the computations and print it to pdf file.

As of now fibonnaci, determinants, cramer's rule have a function.

NOTE: 
to be able to save a pdf file, use or import the library "itextpdf-5.5.4.jar" to your project from the application
